-Chris is running the february promo
-All the starter bpack offer in the step 1 - we are just testing different angles
-We just started testing the Food Babe account today and it is already doing good. 
-Everything is breaking that 0.83 threshold. 

-Some testing CW45 I91 Winning Image

-Derek got on the phone with customers,they weren't using it past 6 pages.

-CW74 is for split test between pages.  CW74 is for the only 6 packet starter pack that we are testing. (CHRISTIAN) said works better but you can check. 

-A few 50% off tests going on. 
-Sinterest, a bunch of 50% off page tests, wondering how that is going.

-Goal by the end of the month to be at 3k / day
-Been running in the cold traffic 

-See if we can get people through the product faster.  Wanted to see a conversion lift.

-very Beginning they were similar.  Now the 6 pack has a 35-40% increase in conversion rate.  Revenue per visitor.  Very similar.  More people through there.  Same place where the AOV is up and the conversion rate is up but it is starting to level out.

-Is the LTV of the 6 pack worth more faster. Updated LTV numbers from last week.  6 Pack started last week.  Probably need more time for the 10 pack. 

-Purchase value of the orders for the 10 pack as reported in FB vs. As reported in Shopify.  If there is a small difference and it's still ROI positive then we can ramp it up. 

-Product performance in GA, what product did people buy from a landing page. 

Testing - Looking through orders.  People who visited the satrter page, people who left and then bought the full thing so if we facilitate that with a test we may be able to get the better LTV.

-There are already unique products in the protein with the 3.50 per pack.  We could trigger it off of that. 
-Need to make a decision by the end of this week so on March first we know the product we will be selling when we switch. 

Going to get killed on pick and pack fees with different combos of small items to differentiate the product sale. 

-50% off the 1st month of protein subscription.  What will trigger a starter buyer into a subscriber. 

-Full Size bag of protein test.  Lets see if we can get bigger AOV right off the bat. 

-If we stick with 6 pack would like to test a 24.99 dollar offer to increase the front end as much as possible under 25.  ((((Would we add chocolate vs. Vanilla on that page))))
-1st Month Starter kit, lots of copy tests.

-What is the pre-purchase email sequence like.
-UPsell flow (Price per serving) - Cost per serving language.  
1) Tarter kit betwen 6 and 10 Decide Winner
2) Once we decide we can do a special Klabviyo Campaign for that post purchase email sequnc. 
3) Shipping time will be cut in half.  No package that takes more then 2 days once they amke the shift (from a 5-6 day ship time right now) Once we get that to 2 days, the re-oder sequnce will be faster. 
4) Must decide which test wins the 10 or the 6


-We are moving 5-6 per day. 

-Validate price of starter pack for the orders that we have, whats the positional model of sales.  Lets ramp up with 0.85 spend, the value of this customer isn't the same as that of the subscription orders. 


-Stay towards the 1.0 ROAS level for starter pack heavy campaigns. 

-Starter guide page we have is one of the best pags we have on stacking the offer. 

-What if starter pack was one month kit.
